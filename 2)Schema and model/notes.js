mongoose is used instead of MongoDB drivers because it is more functional than it

mongoose is an object data modelling(ODM) library for MongoDB & Nodejs, providing higher level of 
abstraction

Features:
Schema to model our data and relationships, easy data validation,a simple query API,middleware,etc

Schema- It is where we model our data. Using it, we can describe the structure of our data,default
values and validations.

It is like a class we make docs out this schema like objects out of classes
