 MVC Architecture

 M- Model(Buisness Logic)-Defining the functions for performing different actions on the model
  Ex: Create, Update, quering, Delete,etc Schema,Model,etc
 
 V-View(presentation layer)
View layer - presentation layer which is visible to the user(used serving Web pages but not Web API's)
(HTML CSS and JS) 
 
 C- Controler() application requests, interact with model and views and send back responses to the client
 
We have created controllers in the previous lectures in this tutorial we will create model for the
first time

Till now we were creating,update,deleting json file through express now we will create,update,delete in
our mongoose database

In mongo db the database will automatically check if the id of a document exists or not automatically
